**World Population Analysis**

I've always been curious about how people are distributed across our planet, so I grabbed some World Bank data to find out.
This project takes population figures from 2024 and tries to make sense of them.

I had to do quite a bit of cleaning first – the data came with extra header rows and needed to be merged with country metadata.

After filtering out aggregates and focusing on actual countries, I created a couple of visualizations that tell an interesting story.
One chart shows just how massive South Asia and East Asia & Pacific really are in terms of population (we're talking billions).
The other histogram reveals something I found fascinating – most countries actually have pretty small populations, with just a few giants like India and China dominating the numbers.
The log scale really helps see this pattern clearly.
